# NumPy tutorials for scientific computing in Python

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

In these tutorials, we'll learn how to use numpy from ultraquick tutorials for the essential aspects to kickstart your journey in Machine Learning to more advanced features.

## Recommended Preparation

Before starting this tutorial it is recommended that you have installed [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/) or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index), and have a basic understanding of [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/doc/):

### Google Colab

For tips on running tutorial notebooks in Google Colab, see [Colab Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16pBJQePbqkz3QFV54L4NIkOn1kwpuRrj)

### Conda Environment Setup

Use the first command to create new independent environment for the project. Or use the other two commands to remove or update the Conda environment.

```shell
# To create a conda environment.
conda env create -f environment.yml

# To remove a conda environment.
conda remove --name ml --all

# To update a conda environment when some new libraries are added.
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```
